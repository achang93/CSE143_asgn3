Instructions:
To run our program we will install the necessary dependencies like Keras, TensorFlow, and NumPy. This can be done by running pip install {library_name} in our command line argument. To run our program we will run the following command line argument. python3 assignment3.py (LSTM/RNN) (num_epochs). Here when we run our assignment3.py, we will give an argument to specify to use the LSTM or the RNN model. We should give only one of the two arguments. The second argument should include the number of epochs we will use for our training.
